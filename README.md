# Discord RSS

A simple script that will check RSS feeds for updates, and if there are any found publish a discord
webhook.

## Setup

You can run it in docker using the [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file. Here are the steps I
followed:

1. Create a folder to house everything in

```bash
mkdir discord-rss
```

2. Create your `config.json`

The contents should look something like this:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostdevv/discord-rss/refs/heads/main/config.schema.json",
	"feeds": [],
	"webhooks": []
}
```

3. Copy the docker-compose.yml

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghostdevv/discord-rss/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
```

4. Start the script

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Health Checks

You can optionally add a health check, I designed this with
[uptime kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma) in mind but it should be flexible enough for
other platforms. Please [make an issue](https://github.com/ghostdevv/discord-rss/issues/new) if
there's anything missing! The following example can be added to your `config.json`. It'll make a
`GET` request to the endpoint every 60 seconds.

```json
{
	"healthCheck": {
		"endpoint": "",
		"interval": 60,
		"method": "GET"
	}
}
```
